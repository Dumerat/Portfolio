                    Hi! My name is Yoan, I&apos;m 22 and I like develop things on my free time.
                    I like blinding math with programming and I&apos;m constantly seeking novel challenges to deepen my skills and knowledge. <br/><br/>
                    In 2022, I entered in a OpenClassrooms Course to learn more about web development.
                    We started by learning Frontend and Backend dev also project management and code optimisation.
